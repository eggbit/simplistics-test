# Simplistics Test

A simple Wordpress plugin that fetches reviews from the Google Places API, saves that data to a local database table, reads it back, and outputs results to HTML.

### Usage

Copy `simplistics-test.php` to Wordpress' plugins directory and activate from the admin panel.  Add the `[simplistics_reviews]` shortcode to any page or post and style to your liking.
